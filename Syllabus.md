# BUAN 5405 Python Fundamentals
*Summer 2020*
## Course Description
This course is an introduction to Python, with an emphasis on general programming concepts (structure, logic, data, etc.) that apply to just about any general purpose programming language.  Starting with a review of fundamental programming concepts, the course uses short lessons, quizzes, and coding challenges to cover the basics of how Python is used in a professional Business Analytics setting. The course concludes with a final project designed to demonstrate proficiency. Prerequisites: graduate standing or permission of the instructor.   

## Learning Objectives

### Theory
* To introduce fundamentals of logical reasoning as used in contemporary programming languages
* To survey essential data structures needed to organize, store, and integrate data
* To master syntax, control structures, data types, etc. in the Python programming language
* To introduce Python as a tool for data science

### Practice
* To write Python scripts of moderate length and complexity
* To design and use custom data structures using built-in and third-party data types
* To introduce third-party Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
* To develop proficency with a professional-level data science toolkit (Jupyter, GitHub, etc.)

## Resources
* **Textbook:** Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3, by Charles R. Severance, available [here](https://www.py4e.com/). The PDF, HTML, and Kindle versions are free.
* **Online Tutorials:** [Data Camps’s Online Python Courses](https://www.datacamp.com)
* **Software:** [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (programming environment), git/[GitHub](https://github.com/) (source code management), and Google Drive (https://drive.google.com) (collaborative work)
* **Hardware:** While the software tools are online, you will want a professional-grade laptop or desktop computer with the largest screen and the most RAM you can afford.   
* **Websites:**  
    * Class documents (including this syllabus) are in [Dr. Huntley's GitHub repository](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/buan5405-docs).
    * Programing assignments are posted and managed in GitHub Classroom.
    * Class communications will be via Slack at fairfield-dolan.slack.com. 
    * [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com) exercises will be used to complement the class lessons.
    * The official [Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) covers the Python language and all built-in libraries. When in doubt, [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)

## Student Expectations
This is a graduate class intended for aspiring *professionals*:    

* **Set aside at least 10 hours per week for completing your assignments.** Consider yourself fortunate if you can complete it faster than that, but also make sure that you are not missing something important. Then use the remaining time to study on your own. 
* **Do your own work.** There is no professional benefit to pretending that somebody else's work is your own. We will follow the university's academic honesty policy to the letter. In addition you will have to swear to the following pledge on any graded work: 
  > On my honor as a Fairfield University student, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this assignment.    

    The pledge is a contract. Failure to comply will result in an F for the course. So, try to avoid even the apearance of misconduct. 

* **Be a good teammate and class citizen.** Free-riding and other unprofessional behavior will result in immediate consequences, which may include failing the course.

*If you cannot abide by these policies then please take another course.*

## Assignments and Course Grade
### Professionalism (20% of Course Grade)
Professionals get the job done. As you progress through the course, you will be asked to complete various DataCamp tutorials, challenge exercises, quizzes, and other hands-on work. **Please complete all asignments on time, as specified, using the resources above to the best of your ability.** 
### Quizzes (40% of Course Grade)
There will be five quizzes, with the lowest grade dropped from your quiz average. They will be given on the days shown in the attached schedule of classes. Quizzes are closed book and closed notes. They are designed to last about 25 minutes, though you may take longer if needed. **Quizzes will be graded on the dates given below, after which missing submissions will be assigned a score of 0. After the second missed quiz, the maximum class grade is a B-.** 
### Final Project (40% of Course Grade)
The final project is meant to be a demonstration that the course objectives have been met. Project details and requirements will be distributed in the fourth week of class. **Deliverables are a Jupyter Notebook and a 10 minute structured walkthrough presentation. Class presentations will be submitted via Youtube.** 
### Grading Scale
All assignment grades are entered into the gradebook on a GPA scale, where A is 3.67+, A- is 3.34-3.66, etc. The overall course grade is then the weighted average of the grades.

Any assignment that is not scored on a GPA scale will be normalized as follows:  
    
    Grade Points = 3.5 + ½(x-μ)/σ,   

where
- x is the student’s raw score for the assignment
- μ and σ are the class average and standard deviation for the assignment
- Note that the average score is always 3.5, which is an A-. 

After scaling, the expected grade distribution is approximately:

| Grade      | GP Range         | Frequency |
| :--------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| A          | Above 3.66       | 30%       |
| A-         | \[3.34, 3.66)    | 40%       |
| B+         | \[3.0 3.34)      | 24%       |
| B or lower | Below 3          | 6.5%      ||
